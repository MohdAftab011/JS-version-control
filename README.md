# ðŸŒ± Groot VCS â€” A Lightweight Version Control System

> A modern, Node.js-based version control system inspired by Git â€” built from scratch to understand the internals of branching, merging, and commit management.  
> ðŸš€ Enhanced with advanced features like branching, intelligent merging, remote simulation, and a visual commit graph.

## ðŸ§  Overview

**Groot VCS** is a custom version control system implemented in **Node.js** that mimics the core behavior of Git.  
It manages file snapshots, tracks history, and supports branches, merges, remotes, and diffs â€” giving you hands-on experience with the underlying mechanisms of Git.

This project demonstrates deep understanding of **data structures, system design, and content-addressable storage**, and is fully **resume-worthy**.
